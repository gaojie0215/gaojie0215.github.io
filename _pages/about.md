Dr. Jie Gao is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Transport and Planning, specializing in multimodal transport network sustainability. Her research centres on the area of smart transportation, developing innovative methodologies and applications to address efficiency and sustainability issues in shared mobility systems and electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling.

Situated at the interface of Artificial Intelligence (AI), microeconomics, and operations research, her work focuses on data-driven and behaviour-driven optimization, mechanism design, dynamic pricing design, and interactive decision-making through reinforcement learning. Her work aims to create intelligent, incentive-aligned systems that facilitate efficient, connected, and sustainable transportation for next-generation cities.

She received her Ph.D. in December 2021 from Concordia University in Canada, successfully defending her thesis entitled "Matching Mechanisms Design for Shared Mobility Systems." Following her doctoral studies, she joined the Decision Science Department at HEC Montréal as a postdoctoral researcher. In this role, she focuses on developing Bayesian optimization techniques for large-scale simulation-based optimization, particularly in the context of urban transportation systems. In May 2023, she was awarded the FQRSC (Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture) Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Currently, she is expanding her interdisciplinary research to develop AI models and techniques that are adaptable to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in multimodal transportation systems.
